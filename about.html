<h1>As a budding UX Designer currently honing my skills through an apprenticeship, I find myself deeply immersed in the world of design. My journey began in the realm of graphic design, where I spent nearly five years mastering the art of visual communication.This experience cemented my belief that while good design can sell a product, great design has the power to inspire belief and evoke emotions. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid sports enthusiast and have a unique passion for rug making, which allows me to explore my creativity in diverse ways. 
At the heart of my work and hobbies lies a deep appreciation for thoughtful and impactful design, a principle that guides me both in my career and personal endeavors.</h1>
