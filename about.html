  <h4>
    As a new UX Designer now honing my talents through an apprenticeship, I find
    myself totally immersed in the world of design. My path began in the field
    of graphic design, where I spent over five years perfecting the art of
    visual communication.This encounter reinforced my opinion that, while decent
    design may sell a product, great design has the ability to inspire belief
    and elicit emotions. Aside from my professional projects, I am an avid
    sports fan and have a special interest in
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_joe_i/?hl=en">photography</a> and
    artistic outlets, which allow me to express myself in a variety of ways. A
    profound respect for meaningful and impactful design is central to my work
    and hobbies, and it serves as a guiding principle in both my professional
    and personal life.
