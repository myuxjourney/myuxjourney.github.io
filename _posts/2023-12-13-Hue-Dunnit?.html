    In a perfect vibrant world, no one would be left out on perceiving colors. We would all see the same shade of blue, green, red etc. We are far from a perfect world and that is where the essences of color accessibility comes into play. Screens can act like the windows of the world and in today's digital age, we probably look out a digital window more than we do our very own windows. It isn't just about seeing colors though, it also about how we utilize those colors for those less fortunate. How can we help those when it matters most?<br><br>

    Green means go, red means stop when it comes to driving. What happens if the person driving next to me doesn't see those colors? Oddly enough when it comes to color blindness red and green are often harder to differentiate from each other. In the digital world, we would create contrast checkers or color-blind apps/plugins that help solve some of those issues automatically. That doesn't mean we should design without considering basic concepts like color contrast though.  We should be designing to eliminate those deficiencies so that we can make the world a better and safer place. <br><br>

    Sometimes designers can feel limited to this aspect of “color limiting” due to the fact we are taking colors away but we should always be thinking outside of the box and trying to innovate without the idea that we have to give up creativity. We can use textures and patterns to differentiate certain elements or play with different shades or tints of color. The world can be a colorful place and we should be using the tools and technology so that it is colorful for all. <br><br>
