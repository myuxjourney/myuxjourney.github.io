  In today's digital age, blah blah blah, yeah, I started my last blog this exact way. I am out of office this week, sorry!
  Creativity can be a struggle, and like anything else in the world, learning something new can also feel like a struggle.
  As web design evolves, so does the fact that there are always different methods of madness. So choosing the right "ruler" can 
  make all the difference that helps create responsive websites.
</p>

<p>Pixels (px) Think of pixels as little building pieces. Their pixel-perfect control makes them perfect for elements with fixed 
   sizes, such as borders, icons, and images. On responsive layouts, where elements must adjust, or high-resolution screens, their rigidity may present issues.</p>

<p>In em's, The font size of its parent element determines how this unit scales.  Because ems ensure that text sizes within nested elements adjust proportionately,
   they are ideal for responsive typography. However, we should use caution in highly nested structures as unexpected font sizes can throw off the harmony. </p>

<p>Rems provide regulated pliability. They ensure consistency throughout your layout by scaling according to the root font size of your entire document. Because of 
   this, rems is perfect for responsive design, which guarantees that your website will flow naturally across a range of screen sizes. </p>

<p>Consider percentages as chameleons that change color and orientation in response to the container they are in. They are excellent at defining margins, heights, 
   and widths inside sections or grids so that components keep their proportions in relation to their container. </p>
