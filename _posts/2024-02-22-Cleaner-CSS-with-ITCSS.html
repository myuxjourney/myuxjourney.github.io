  <p>The Inverted Triangle CSS, or ITCSS, provides a methodical way to arrange 
    your CSS code that addresses specificity and maintainability problems. The 
    concept of layers, each with progressively higher levels of specificity, forms 
    the basis of this methodology. Imagine an inverted triangle, with highly specific 
    modifications located at the pointed bottom and broad, foundational styles sitting 
    at the top.</p>

  <p>Usually, this layered system begins with global settings, which contain variables 
    for fonts, colors, and spacing.  Next, a layer of functions and mixins tools appears, 
    promoting reuse. The 'generic' layer is where you apply basic styles and reset the browser's 
    defaults. The "elements," which are styles for unformatted HTML tags, and the "objects," 
    which are concerned with structure and layout, come next.  Lastly, highly visual, class-based 
    styles reside in "components," which can override earlier rules as necessary.</p>

  <p>ITCSS's ability to simplify the administration of intricate stylesheets is what makes it so 
    beautiful. You can decrease the possibility of excessively specific selectors, which can cause 
    problems later on, by progressively increasing specificity. Finding and changing the rules you 
    need becomes much easier thanks to the logical division of styles, especially as your project 
    grows.</p>

  <p>Despite requiring initial work to incorporate into your process, ITCSS is an effective tool for 
    encouraging scalable, clean, and maintainable CSS code. ITCSS provides a methodical way to attain 
    stylistic harmony if you're trying to tame the CSS beast.</p>
