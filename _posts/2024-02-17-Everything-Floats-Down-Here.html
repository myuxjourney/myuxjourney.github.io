    Imagine building a webpage is like creating a magazine layout. Text flows
    neatly into columns, and pictures are often tucked to the side to make
    things look awesome. CSS floats make this magic happen for web designers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think of a CSS float like giving an image a superpower â€” it can break out of
    the normal webpage flow and "float" either to the left or right. Any text
    around it will cleverly wrap around the floated image, just like in
    magazines.

  <p>
    Let's look at a quick example: you have an awesome picture of a puppy you
    want on the right side of a paragraph. You give the puppy-image a CSS float
    of "right". Now, your text gracefully flows around the image, creating that
    polished layout look.

    Floats are super versatile, you can use them to place navigation menus
    neatly to the side, arrange image galleries, and lots more. A
    floated element escapes the normal webpage structure, so you sometimes need
    a little extra code to keep things neat, but in essence, that's what makes
    them powerful!
